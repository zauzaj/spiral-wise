Answer on your questions:

- What are the maximum dimensions for your solution?
There is no limitation on dimensions as values are generated based on user inputs

- Why are these the maximum dimensions, ie what is limiting it?
No limits

- What is good about your solution?
Elegant, clean and fast solution with recursion

- What is not good about your solution?
Quite hard to debug and understand for someone who doesn't know Ruby and recursion.

- Bonus: provide us with another solution for the same problem (in code or by describing it). In what way are the solutions different?

This could be done with multiple loops, where we can iterate trough rows & columns and always. It would be much bigger and quite unreadable, with multiple `each` loops.
